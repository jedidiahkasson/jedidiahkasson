Hello, I'm Jedidiah. 

My focus is on building simple automation tools to improve my day-to-day workflow. I also enjoy building ~tiny~ useless programs for the sake of fun, so you may see some of those.
Currently I am working with Golang but you may see some Python here and there.

It is my intention to eventually begin actively contributing to the various open source projects I've used over the years. Once my skills are up to par anyway.
